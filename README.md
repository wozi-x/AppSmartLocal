# SmartLocal

**Effortless Figma Localization with Your Preferred AI.**

SmartLocal bridges the gap between Figma designs and AI translation. Instead of relying on rigid, built-in translation services, SmartLocal generates context-aware prompts that you can use with **any** AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepL, etc.) to get high-quality, culturally relevant translations.

## ✨ Features

-   **🤖 AI-Agnostic**: Use any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) with generated prompts.
-   **🎨 Perfect Style Preservation**: Maintains fonts, colors, and auto-layout.
-   **🚀 Batch Localization**: Generate multiple languages in one pass.
-   **📏 Non-Destructive**: Clones and positions localized frames below originals.
-   **🧠 Context-Aware**: Extracts text hierarchy for better translations.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Select**: Click on any Frame, Component, or Instance in Figma.
2.  **Generate**: Open SmartLocal, enter your target languages (e.g., `es, fr`), and click **Generate Prompt**.
3.  **Translate**: Paste the generated prompt into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
4.  **Apply**: Copy the JSON response from the AI and paste it back into SmartLocal.
5.  **Done**: Watch as SmartLocal creates perfectly styled duplicates for each language!

## 💻 Usage

### Generating Translations

3.  In the "Target Languages" input, type codes like `es` (Spanish), `fr` (French), `jp` (Japanese).
4.  Hit **Generate & Copy Prompt**.
5.  Go to ChatGPT/Claude and paste.

### Applying Translations
